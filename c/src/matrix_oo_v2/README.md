# Introduction

Sample matrix implementation illustrating object-oriented techniques in C99.

It is clear that the techniques presented here have not the pretension to
replace C++, but it provides enough to do serious object-oriented
programming:

* The procedural model using C functions
* The abstract data type model using public interface and private
  implementation as well as data and names encapsulation.
* The object-oriented model using (multiple) inheritance and polymorphism
  which allows to manipulate different object types through a common
  interface.
